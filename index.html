        </header>
        <main>
            <p>My name is Cas (short for Cassandra).
            <br>I enjoy nature, yoga & meditation, and singing in the car.
            <br>But my favorite thing of all is sugar. I am an addict.
            <br><br>I'm originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
            <br>but I have been living in Seattle for about a year and a half.
            <br><br>I have always been curious about coding, but it's so far outside of my comfort zone that I needed some encouragement to start learning.
            I am very fortunate to have a wonderful partner who works in tech.
            One day this past spring, we were plotting how to maximize our bank accounts, and he encouraged me to finally look into taking some courses online. 
            I started learning on Codecademy and immediately took to it. I'm hooked!
            <br><br>I'm not exactly sure what I'd like to do with this new skill I'm learning; 
            <br>all I know for now is that I want to get a job that allows me to learn every day and to build for my future.
            Eventually, I'd like to be able to work remotely and travel or relocate to another part of the world.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>While my educational background is in psychology and most of my professional experience is in healthcare, I have actually been working in hospitality for the past three years, which would make this my... third career change before age 30!
            <br>Let's just say my parents are SO PROUD.
            <br>Sometimes it feels like I'm just shuffling through career paths to see what sticks, and I guess that's exactly what I'm doing.
            <br>But it's not completely aimless.
            </p> -->
